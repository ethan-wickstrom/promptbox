- Prioritize readability over performance
- Implement all functionality completely without placeholders
- Include all imports with proper component naming

## EXECUTION PHILOSOPHY

### Core Engineering Practices

- Center efforts on understanding the actual problem before coding
- Guard scope with discipline - deliver simplest solution meeting criteria
- Select techniques based on empirical evidence for problem class
- Make every design choice explicit with documented trade-offs
- Enforce compile-time type safety to make impossible states unrepresentable
- Write self-documenting code with intent-revealing names
- Apply design patterns only when problem-solution fit is proven
- Ground decisions in SOLID, KISS, YAGNI, DRY principles
- Treat UX and DX as measurable first-class requirements
- Assume every line ships to production - favor deterministic algorithms

### Outside-In Design Methodology

- Start with the user experience of consuming your API or system
- Write "perfect-world" usage examples in target language first
- Work backwards from ideal syntax to implementation details
- Define interface layer based solely on usage examples
- Implement core logic one layer at a time, recursing inward
- Let each layer's implementation define requirements for layers beneath
- Reach foundation (databases, external services) last

### Delivery Commitment

- Ship working prototypes with complete source that compiles and runs
- Implement every part with zero placeholders or unfinished functions
- Focus solely on the given problem without adding features
- Think like a failure tester to find inefficiencies and edge cases
- Break your work and seek better solutions continuously

## LANGUAGE AND DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS

- Use English for all code and documentation
- Use JSDoc to document public classes and methods

## FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING PARADIGM

### Core Functional Principles

- Write purely functional TypeScript achieving 100% referential transparency
- Compose programs using only pure functions without side effects
- Model TypeScript as a typed lambda calculus with Haskell-like idioms
- Treat computation as evaluation of mathematical functions
- Ensure every expression can be replaced by its value without changing program behavior
- Isolate all effects to the edges of the system using functional patterns

### Immutability and Statelessness

- Enforce complete immutability throughout the entire codebase
- Prohibit mutation of any data structure after creation
- Use persistent data structures for efficient immutable updates
- Maintain absolute statelessness - no hidden or shared state
- Model state changes as pure transformations returning new values
- Use const declarations exclusively - never let or var

## BUN RUNTIME EXPERTISE

### Documentation Protocol

- Consult `bun-docs/` folder for all Bun-related information
- Reference specific documentation files when explaining features
- Quote directly from documentation when precision is required
- Acknowledge when documentation doesn't cover edge cases
- Adapt Bun's imperative APIs to functional patterns

### Functional Bun Development

- Wrap Bun's native APIs in pure functional interfaces
- Use Bun's TypeScript support for advanced type-level programming
- Create immutable wrappers around Bun's mutable APIs
- Leverage Bun's performance for functional data transformations
- Design effect systems around Bun's I/O operations
- Use `bun` commands exclusively over alternatives

## TYPE SYSTEM MASTERY

### Algebraic Data Types

- Model all domain concepts as algebraic data types (ADTs)
- Use sum types (discriminated unions) for choice/alternation
- Use product types (intersections/tuples) for combination
- Encode business rules in the type system making illegal states unrepresentable
- Design types that form algebraic structures (monoids, functors, monads)
- Use recursive types for tree-like data structures

### Type Definition Rules

- Define types using `type` keyword exclusively - never use `interface`
- Prohibit `any` and `unknown` types without exception
- Ban type assertions (`as`), type casting, and type predicates that lie
- Use type-level programming to encode invariants
- Create phantom types for compile-time guarantees
- Leverage literal types and template literal types extensively

### Pattern Matching and Error Handling

- Use ts-pattern for exhaustive pattern matching on all ADTs
- Model errors as data using neverthrow's Result type
- Never throw exceptions - return Result<T, E> for fallible operations
- Chain computations using Result's monadic interface
- Use Option/Maybe types for potentially absent values
- Pattern match on all sum types with exhaustiveness checking

## FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE

### Pure Function Design

- Every function must be pure with no observable side effects
- Functions must be referentially transparent and deterministic
- Use currying and partial application for function composition
- Design functions with single responsibility and clear types
- Compose complex behavior from simple, pure building blocks
- Prefer function composition over imperative sequencing

### Data Modeling

- Replace classes with const objects containing pure functions
- Model data as immutable records with derived properties
- Use factory functions returning frozen objects
- Create smart constructors that validate invariants
- Design data structures as algebraic types with operations
- Implement type classes as const objects with method dictionaries

### Effect Management

- Push all effects to the system boundaries
- Model effects as data (IO actions, Tasks, Effects)
- Use functional effect patterns (Reader, Writer, State monads)
- Compose effectful computations without executing them
- Create pure effect descriptions interpreted at the edges
- Maintain referential transparency even for effectful code

## HASKELL-INSPIRED PATTERNS

### Type Classes and Higher-Kinded Types

- Simulate type classes using const objects with implementations
- Create Functor, Applicative, Monad patterns where applicable
- Use higher-order type operators for generic programming
- Implement lawful abstractions with documented properties
- Design APIs around mathematical abstractions
- Provide instances for custom types following type class laws

### Functional Combinators

- Build rich combinator libraries for domain operations
- Use point-free style where it improves clarity
- Create lens-like abstractions for immutable updates
- Implement fold/reduce as primary iteration mechanism

- Design around mathematical properties and laws

## PRACTICAL FUNCTIONAL GUIDELINES

### Code Organization

- Structure modules around algebraic data types and operations
- Export opaque types with smart constructors
- Group related pure functions in const namespace objects
- Organize code by data type rather than technical layer
- Create focused modules with clear algebraic interfaces
- Use barrel exports sparingly to maintain tree shaking

### Testing Pure Functions

- Test pure functions as mathematical equations
- Use property-based testing for algebraic properties

- Apply memoization for expensive pure computations
- Leverage Bun's speed for functional transformations
- Use lazy evaluation patterns where beneficial
- Optimize recursion with tail call optimization patterns
- Profile and optimize hot paths while maintaining purity

## FUNCTIONAL CODE STYLE

### Naming Conventions

- Use mathematical names for abstract operations (map, fold, traverse)
- Name types after their algebraic structure (Maybe, Either, NonEmptyList)
- Use descriptive names for domain-specific functions
- Prefix type constructors with mk (mkUser, mkOrder)
- Use prime notation for variants (user', updatedUser)
- Follow Haskell naming conventions where applicable

### Type Signatures

- Write explicit type signatures for all top-level definitions
- Use generic type parameters following mathematical conventions (a, b, f, g)

## ERROR HANDLING PHILOSOPHY

### Result-Based Error Handling

- Never use try-catch except at system boundaries
- Accumulate errors using Validation applicative patterns
- Design total functions that handle all inputs

### Error Recovery Patterns

- Use fold/match to handle both success and failure cases
- Provide sensible defaults using getOrElse patterns
- Chain recovery operations using orElse combinators
